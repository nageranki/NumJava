NumJava is a java usable library that mimics functions from NumPy. 
There are currently 4 packages, namely NDArray, matlib, strings and linalg that have been coded for this semester's project. We have written over 20 classes (java src files) that mimic various NumPy functions.

NOTE: The project is still under progress, and new files will be added until the end of this semester.
